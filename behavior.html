<header><h2>It's time to learn!</h2></header>
<p>There are definetly some very expressive, and talkative cats out there! However, the majority of cats, especially if you just got them and they are nervous about their new home, tend to be quieter and harder to read. This page is to help you understand some basics of body language, to help the bonding between you and your new pet!</p>
</div>
<div id="wrapper">
<header><h2>Tail Talk</h2></header>
<p>Cats express a ton of emotion through their tails, and it is oftentimes the EASIEST way to understand how your cat is feeling. Here are some simple examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Upright tail with a hook at the end:</strong>This tends to signify excitement, friendliness, and curiosity. Many cats do this when their owner comes home, to show that they are happy to see them!</li>
		<li><strong>Puffed-up tail:</strong>Cats prickle up their fur to look bigger and more intimidating. This is done when they are startled of scared of something, this means they were probably spooked and want to look tough!</li>
		<li><strong>Tail flicking rapidly:</strong> This usually happens when the cat is agitated or annoyed. Sometimes this occurs while playing to express that they are done and want to be left alone</li>
		<li><strong>Tail tucked:</strong> Usually means they are feeling nervous or submissive</li>
	</ul>

<header><h2>Decoding Meows and More</h2></header>
<p>Cats are unique creatures with their own personalities and ways of communicating. Learn to understand your cat by bonding and listening to them. Cats mostly only meow to communicate with humans, so they're either just being talkative or have something to tell you</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Chirps or trills:</strong> Friendly, happy, or calling you to follow them. Sometimes chirps show they are excited about something, like when they see a bird outside the window!</li>
      		<li><strong>Loud, demanding meow:</strong> Feed. Me. Now.</li>
      		<li><strong>Low growl or hiss:</strong> They're feeling threatened or upset‚Äîback off.</li>
      		<li><strong>Purring:</strong> Usually happy and relaxed, but can also be a self-soothing thing when they're sick or anxious. More than likely though, it's to show contentment.</li>
       </ul>
</div>
<div id="wrapper">
<header><h2>Body Language Basics</h2></header>
	<ul>
      		<li><strong>Arched back, fur standing:</strong> Classic ‚ÄúHalloween cat.‚Äù They‚Äôre trying to look bigger. This is usually an indimidation tactic (talked about previously), but sometimes it is done in a playful manner!</li>
      		<li><strong>Loaf position (paws tucked under):</strong> Comfy, chill, and feeling safe.</li>
      		<li><strong>Rolling onto back:</strong> Could be a trap‚Äîbe cautious! It's a sign of trust, but not always an invitation to pet the belly. Some cats like their belly GENTLY rubbed, however most cats do not like being touched there as it is sensitive and vulnerable.</li>
    	</ul>
</div>
<div id="wrapper">
<header><h2>What the Ears & Eyes Say</h2></header>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Ears forward:</strong> Interested or curious, you'll likely see this when they notice you bring the food out!</li>
		<li><strong>Ears back or sideways ("airplane ears"):</strong> Angry, scared, or overstimulated. They are most likely actively upset if their ears are back, while most likely startled or aware of something if their ears are sideways</li>
		<li><strong>Slow blink:</strong> This is a kitty's way of saying they love and trust you. Slow blinking back is a small way to show you understand and love them!</li>
		<li><strong>Wide pupils:</strong> Excited, playful, or nervous depending on the situation. You may see this a lot while playing with them!</li>
	</ul>
